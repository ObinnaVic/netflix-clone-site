# netflix-clone-site

The reason behind the building of the netflix website was to get a good and indept knowledge on html and CSS. 
This is why the site is built with only pure CSS AND HTML codes from scratch to end without functionalities. No libraries.

Through this activity, I was able to build a full webpage with the use of only css grid layout system.
I was able to solve a whole lot of problems and got a good grasp of the use of Pure html and css to build a website.
